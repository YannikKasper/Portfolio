To switch on my light I make a simple HTTP request to my local raspberry pi which sends my light repeater a wireless command."

This APP should take care about all the activities a bar has. You should be able to order a beer or food, you could have challenged your friends or played against other tables. The bar should have got a dashboard where they can track all orders and table logins. Unfortunately we stopped programming the latest 10 percent because we could not integrate the important payment procedure. We also had less time and one guy of us moved away from Cologne. Finally, we put this project on hold."

We used a convolutional neuronal network with only 6 convolutional layers. The project was quite successful but if we had added more car lines to separate we would have got a less accuracy."
